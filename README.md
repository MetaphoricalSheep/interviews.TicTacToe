# Interview Project: Tic Tac Toe

This is a Tic Tac Toe game that I wrote for a Senior PHP developer interview.

The project was created using CodeIgniter 3.1.3, bootstrap 4.0.0-alpha.6 and Doctrine 2 running on PHP 7.1.0 and Percona-Server 5.7 (Mysql Fork). 
Please stay away from IE...
I tested it quickly on Firefox and it seemed fine. Used the latest build of Chrome while developing.


## The Specification

> Using the Codeigniter framework (http://www.codeigniter.com/), build a tic tac toe game with the following features:
> * Take a name for the two players and begin a new game.
> * Use basic styling for the grid using css.
> * Allow the players to click the grid to make their move, and highlight when the game is finished.
> * Store the results of each match in a MySQL database, and have a page to view the results.
> * Use the bootstrap framework to make it responsive in the following ways:
>   * On mobile device, make the game full screen.
>   * On desktop browser have the results of the last 5 matches on the right hand side â€“ do this in bootstrap, not php.
>
> * If you have more time, then please look at making an option of playing against the computer
